# Exercise 1.1: Explore the python home page python.org and read some topics that interest you.

# Exercise 1.2: Open the hello_world.py file.
# Make a typo somewhere in the line and run the program again.
# Try to make a typo that generates an error.
# Try to understand the error message.
# Try to make a typo that does not generate an error.
# Why did it not make an error?

# Contents of hello_world.py:

print("Hello Python world!")

# Generally, changing anything within the quotation marks in the string will not generate an error.
# That is because python simply prints the contents inside the quotation marks.
# If you change the word "print" to say "pirnt," Python will not recognize this as a print statement.
# That is because the print function is a built-in function and Python will only recognize it if written correctly.

# So this will not generate an error:

print("Hello Pyton world!")

# But this will:

# pirnt("Hello Pyton world!")

# Exercise 1.3: Assuming programming skills were not an issue, what would you build?
# This is a creative exercise to get you to start thinking about projects you'd like to make. 
# Describe three programs you'd like to create.

# I'd like to create:

# 1) A program to help with my productivity. 
# It would have a 'start studying' button and it would close/self-block any time-wasting apps like social media.
# It would open my programming software and my last coding project. 
# It would go into my files and play some calming background music. 

# 2) A program to keep track of books I've read.
# It would let me store books I've read.
# It would let me update my progress in real-time. 
# It would let me record my thoughts and opinions about the books I've read.

# 3) A program to help with my budget.
# It would look over my credit card/bank statements.
# It would track my spending in each category as well as changes over time.
# It would recommend areas where I could save money.
