# Exercise 10.1: Open a blank file in the a text editor.
# Write a few sentences about Python.
# Start each line with the phrase 'In Python you can...'
# Save the file as learning_python.txt in the same directory as the chapter exercises.
# Write a program that reads this file and prints the contents three times:
# once by reading the entire file,
# once by looping over the file object,
# and once by storing the lines in a list and then using them outside the with block.

# Syntax: replace('original_word','new_word')
