# Exercise 4.1: Think of at least three types of pizza. 
# Store the types of pizza in a list
# Use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.
# Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of each pizza.
# Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that states 
# how much you like pizza.

# Exercise 4.10: Use one of the programs from this chapter.
# At the end of the program, add new lines that perform the following tasks:

# 1) Print the message: The first three items in the list are:
# and then use a slice to print the first three items from the list.

# 2) Print the message Three items from the middle of the list are:
# and then use a slice to print three items from the middle of the list.

# 3) Print the message: The last three items in the list are:

# Exercise 4.13: Suppose a buffet-style restaurant only serves five basic foods.
# Think of five basic foods and store them in a tuple.
# Try to modify one of the items, and make sure Python rejects the change.
# Now suppose the restaurant changes two items on the menu.
# Add a line that re-writes the tuple.

# Exercise 4.14: Look through the PEP 8 style guide at 
# python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

# Exercise 4:15: Choose three of the programs from this chapter
# modify them according to PEP 8 guidelines.
# Use four spaces for each indentation level. 
# Use less than 80 characters on each line. 
# Set your editor to show a vertical guideline at the 80th character position.
# Don't use blank lines excessively in your program files.
